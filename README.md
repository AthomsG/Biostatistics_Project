## Abstract:
This study investigates the impact of various risk factors on the survival time of patients diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The analysis employs log-normal regression to assess the statistical significance of risk factors. The results indicate that the treatment with D-penicillamine (DBCA) did not exhibit statistical significance, suggesting no significant difference in survival time between individuals receiving DBCA and those receiving the placebo. Furthermore, the presence of ascites was strongly associated with shorter survival times.
